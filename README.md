# Online-Laboratory
An Online Laboratory app developed in the spring-boot framework.
This project was part of the Software Engineering course offered at the University of Tehran under the supervision of Dr. Ghasemi. 
In this project, people can request different laboratory services such as injection from different laboratories. Upon request, they will be given time and place options to choose from.
People in charge will come to the place at the specified time and do the services. At the end, people can observe the result of their tests in a online format. 
All the things mentioned alongside other functionalities are included in the project with their api. In other words, the whole project can be used as the back-end part of the project.
